				Everybody in 280 Riverside Drive agrees – they love the doormen. What some can’t agree on is the management.
            </p>
			<p>
				Some renters of rent-regulated units at the <a href="https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2464.pdf" target="_blank">landmarked</a> Upper West Side apartment building may be getting lesser treatment from management than their market rate neighbors. 
			</p>
            <p> 
                Some tenants have alleged shoddy maintenance and frustration with the management company, RCR Management. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One tenant had to request repeated repairs for the same leaky bathroom ceiling four times this year. Another tenant said to communicate with RCR Management, the company makes tenants use snail mail and are “grudging in their help”.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, those paying market rate for their apartments have few complaints. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Former tenant, ICU doctor Matthew Baldwin, loved his eight year tenure at 280. After the ceiling in his toddler’s bedroom needed repairs due to a leak in the apartment above, Baldwin asked for half off that month’s rent, since he couldn’t use one of the two bedrooms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “I always felt like if I was reasonable with them, they were reasonable with me,” said Baldwin, speaking of management.
            </p>
            <P> 
                One former tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment echoed Baldwin’s sentiment of ease with management. To break the lease early, “It was just a phone call, and then they let me leave,” the tenant said. 
            </P>

                The building, built in 1926, is owned by Oxford Towers LLC, whose head officer is Morris Schreiber. According to <a href="https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/address/MANHATTAN/280/RIVERSIDE%20DRIVE" target="_blank">Justfix.org</a>, Schreiber owns 42 properties in NYC, many of which are concentrated on the Upper West Side. His real estate portfolio <a href="https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/address/MANHATTAN/280/RIVERSIDE%20DRIVE/portfolio" target="_blank">exceeds</a> $400 million dollars, according to publicly available deeds, yet Schreiber maintains an almost non-existent profile in the press.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2015, when Morris Schreiber’s name first appeared on mortgage documents for 280 Riverside Drive—a mortgage which totaled $84 million—there have been <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLiIs4w_Q9RxNrbfTR8hJB_MeA5AnT90BJTUqa3ZUUE/edit#gid=1454616539" target="_blank">227 complaints</a> via <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data" target="_blank">311.</a> Five of those were about lead and eight were about paint or plaster. 13 complaints were made about dirty or unsanitary conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lead complaints were the subject of a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=9J9kf484iNGgKY916FwLnw==" target="_blank">2021 lawsuit</a> brought against Morris Schreiber by Susan Seo, who lived at 280 Riverside Drive in a rent-stabilized apartment with her five year-old twins. The twins had tested positive for lead.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=9J9kf484iNGgKY916FwLnw==" target="_blank">suit</a> sought lead-based paint abatement, referencing multiple “Class ‘C’” housing violations reported by the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The respondents – Schreiber and Oxford Towers LLC – <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=T/aziLADqcnEfNydbQHRfA==" target="_blank">argued</a> they were not responsible for all lead paint abatement in the unit since Seo had possession of the apartment prior to the enactment of Local Law 1. The respondents <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=T/aziLADqcnEfNydbQHRfA==" target="_blank">also said</a> they had “completed work necessary to remove all lead paint violations,” something which Seo disputed in the suit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/fix-lead-paint-hazards-english.pdf">Local Law 1</a> of 2004 requires landlords to identify and fix lead paint hazards in the apartments of young children. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A settlement in the suit was reached, where the respondents – Schreiber et al. – had to “remediate all areas found to contain lead.” That said, as part of the deal, Seo forewent any monetary claims for attorneys' fees or alternative housing accommodations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1095796020980722" target="_blank">Between 1993 and 2019</a>, New York City lost nearly four hundred thousand regulated apartments to high-rent vacancy deregulation – a tool used by landlords to convert apartments once the rent passes a certain threshold. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&leg_video=&bn=A08281&term=2019&Text=Y" target="_blank">2019 Housing Stability and Protection Act (HSTPA)</a> did away with this so–called vacancy decontrol tool. That said, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/12/23/rent-regulated-apartments-registration-missing/" target="_blank">THE CITY analyzed data</a> from the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal which showed a decrease in the number of New York City’s rent regulated apartments from 2019 to 2022. There were 974,000 rent-regulated apartments registered in 2019, and only 858,000 in 2022.  
            </p>
            <p>
                At 280 Riverside Drive, 12 rent-regulated units have been converted to market rate <a href="https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/address/MANHATTAN/280/RIVERSIDE%20DRIVE/portfolio" target="_blank">since 2007.</a> Before Morris Schreiber, property records show that Mary Schreiber—relation to Morris unknown—first appeared on deed and mortgage records for 280 Riverside Drive in <a href="https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentImageView?doc_id=FT_1400000039940" target="_blank">1983.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>           
                Properties in Schreiber’s portfolio – overall – shed 420 rent-regulated apartments overall <a href="https://whoownswhat.justfix.org/en/address/MANHATTAN/280/RIVERSIDE%20DRIVE/portfolio" target="_blank">since 2007.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, according to analysis of housing data by <a href="https://projects.thecity.nyc/rent-stabilized-map/" target="_blank">THE CITY,</a> 280 Riverside Drive showed no reduction in registered rent-regulated apartments after 2019, when HSTPA was enacted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the high costs associated with bringing vacant rent-stabilized apartments up to code with lead abatement and other mandatory renovations, owners now don’t want those tenants to move out, said Michael Johnson, communications director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group.
            </p>
            <p>
                “There’s not really a pathway to do a gut renovation and make it make financial sense,” he said. “That’s why we see tens of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments that are just empty right now and aren’t going to be put back online.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The average listing for market rate apartments in 280 Riverside Drive building is $5,753, with market rate one-bedroom apartments for north of $3,000, according to apartment listing site <a href="https://streeteasy.com/building/280-riverside-drive-new_york/6a" target="_blank">        StreetEasy. </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Former tenant Katrina Hermanson, a teaching fellow at Hobart William Smith Colleges, and her partner paid below market rate for a one-bedroom for two years through the pandemic. They decided to leave once management was set to raise their rent by $800.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Hermanson said the building was fancy but in disrepair – the east wing’s elevator was often broken, and her unit had heat issues that management dragged their feet to fix. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “They definitely put on the facade of being a luxury building, but they do the bare minimum,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like others, Hermanson praised the doormen and staff but had trouble communicating with management, yet said she’s lived in worse places. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Pretty normal New York stuff,” she added.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>When contacted for comment for the story, RCR Management asked for any questions to be sent via mail or fax, and added, “If they’re interested, they’ll be in touch with you.” They denied requests to ask for comment in person or over the phone.</i>
